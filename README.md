## What's New?

## About

`rust-starter` is an empty Rust CLI application with libraries, and few defaults. The goal is to help you bootstrap your next CLI project as quickly as possible while ensuring you make use of the best tools and best-practices that are available today.

There is no configuration required (though we recommend you check all the possible configurations possible). A blank slate will compile, and has a few commands. You can start coding right away!

## FAQ

## Features

non-exhaustive, still under writing

- Clap for Command Line Argument parsing.
- Error Chaining with Failure.
- Configuration management with config-rs.
- Logging.
- CI/CD and a Dockerfile to run your CLI inside a Docker container.
- Code Coverage, Justfile, etc..
- MIT License.

## Quick Bootstrapping

`rust-starter` should compile as is. A `cargo-generate` template is also [available](https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter-generate). For a more detailed introduction, check the [Getting Started](https://rust-starter.github.io/#getting-started) guide.
