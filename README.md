## What's New?

- Version 1.0.0 is released.

## About

`rust-starter` is an empty Rust CLI application with libraries, and few defaults. The goal is to help you bootstrap your next CLI project as quickly as possible while ensuring you make use of the best tools and best-practices that are available today.

There is no configuration required (though we recommend you check all the possible configurations possible). An empty clone will compile, and has a few sample commands. You can start coding right away!
